Hi! I’m **Marcus Wada**, a Computer Engineering student at the **University of Michigan–Dearborn**.  
I split my time between **power systems & data**,  **controls & embedded systems**, and **math**.

- **Power Lab (Research Assistant):**  
  I work on outage analytics, grid modeling, and resilience research. My projects include building PostGIS pipelines for outage–weather–socioeconomic data, developing GPU-cluster simulators and HPC workflows for control systems, creating synthetic distribution system datasets, and designing interactive web platforms with LLM-assisted analysis to make insights more accessible. 
- **MASA – Airbrakes Electronics:** I lead work on **closed-loop airbrake control with data injection detection** and **hardware-in-the-loop** testbeds (STM32/Teensy, IMU + barometer, Kalman filtering).  
- **Teaching:** I’m an SI leader for Calculus, designing worksheets and running problem-solving sessions.

**Interests:** outage resilience · controls & estimation · aerospace systems · interactive data tools
